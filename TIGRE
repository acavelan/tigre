Indentation:
=============

Allman style, also known as ANSI style or BSD style. This is what Tigre
uses but you are free to use your favorite indent style.

Conventions:
=============

Tigre uses its own coding conventions to be as simple as possible:

* Naming:
- private attributes start with an underscore (ex: _name)
- namespaces, functions and methods start with a lowercase letter
- the underscore is use as a separator for C code (ex: some_cool_name)
- whereas a captial letter is prefered in C++ (ex: someCoolName)

* Comments:
- C style comments are used for documentation (ex: /** ... */)
- C++ double-dash comments are also used inside a block to give a 
specific information on a particular line (ex: // here is a tip)
- comments lenght can exceed 80 characters but it has to remain resonable

* Space:
- Tigre uses a simple line as a vertical separator

Architecture:
==============

- namespaces are written in lowercase
- the namespace holds the interfaces and fully cross-platform code.
- the subdirectories are named after their interface and it can hold 
platform-dependent code or multiple implementations of a class.
