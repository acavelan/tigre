/**
 * An OpenGL context represents many things. A context stores all of the state 
 * associated with this instance of OpenGL. It represents the (potentially 
 * visible) default framebuffer that rendering commands will draw to when not 
 * drawing to a framebuffer object. Think of a context as an object that holds 
 * all of OpenGL; when a context is destroyed, OpenGL is destroyed.
