Tigre
	- Windows compatibility
	- Add an OpenGL 2.x renderer
	- Find some way to make sample "launchers" reusable
	
Sample:	
	- Add lights
	
Priority:
	- rename game -> hl (hight level (abstraction layer))
	- rename draw to render
	- rewrite the renderer by making it a mixin (good multiple inheritance, using A::foo for render and destroy)
	- Renderer : Display, Context, [RendererX]
		=> So a renderer is then asociated to a window and an opengl context, which i think is almost always true
		=> it makes evrything easier
