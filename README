TIGRE (Tiny Graphics Rendering Engine)

What is Tigre ?
================

Tigre is a set of modules suited for advanced visualization or 
video game development.

Tigre is light, flexible and fast.

Tigre is free, open source and cross-platform.

[WARNING] Tigre is under heavy development and it is far from stable.

What is Tigre not ?
====================

By design, Tigre doesn't come with OpenGL context creation, window 
management nor input handling. You need to provide these yourself or by 
using third-party libraries like Qt, glfw, SFML, or SDL. Tigre will fit 
in most projects, giving you the ultimate control. Tigre comes with some 
working examples using Qt, Android and glfw.

Philosphy
==========

KISS principles: Keep It Simple, Stupid

"A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing 
left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - 
Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry

"Everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler." - 
Albert Einstein

Tigre is designed to be simple before everything else. By nature, Tigre 
is light and very flexible.

Platforms
==========

- Linux
- Android
- Windows

It should be easy to port the engine on any platform that supports C++.
